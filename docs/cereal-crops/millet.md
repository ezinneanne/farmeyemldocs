# Millet
Millet refers to a group of small-seeded cereals, including pearl millet (*Pennisetum glaucum*), finger millet (*Eleusine coracana*), and others. It is an ancient crop, widely cultivated in Nigeria for its resilience to drought and poor soils. Millet is a staple food in northern Nigeria, commonly used in making traditional dishes like fura, kunu, and tuwo.

## Seed Types
- **Local Varieties:** Popular for their adaptability but lower in yield. Examples include Maiwa and Gero millet.
- **Improved Varieties:** Released by agricultural research institutes, such as LCIC-MH-1 and SOSAT-C88, which are drought-resistant and high-yielding.

## Market Demand
Millet is in high demand for:
- **Food Production:** Used in making porridge, flour, and beverages like kunu.
- **Animal Feed:** Millet stalks are a valuable feed source for livestock.
- **Export Market:** High-quality millet grains are exported to neighboring countries.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When:** Plant millet with the onset of the rainy season, typically from June to July.
- **Where:** Grows well in arid and semi-arid regions of Nigeria, including Sokoto, Borno, and Yobe states.
- **How:** Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing. Sow seeds at a depth of 2-3 cm with spacing of 75 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Millet Stem Borers**
Larvae of moths bore into stems, disrupting water and nutrient transport.
It causes stunted growth and lodging (falling over of plants).

- **Grasshoppers**
Grasshoppers feed on millet leaves and stems, causing defoliation.
It leads to reduced photosynthesis and weakened plants.

- **Weevils (Stored Grains)**
Beetles that infest stored millet grains, laying eggs inside kernels.
It damages grain quality and weight.

### 2. Diseases
- **Blast Disease**
This is a fungal disease caused by Pyricularia grisea, affecting leaves and grains.
The symptoms are leaf spots and grain discoloration.

- **Downy Mildew**
This is caused by the fungus *Sclerospora graminicola*, it affects young plants.
The symptoms are yellowing and stunted growth.

- **Ergot Disease**
This is a fungal disease caused by Claviceps fusiformis that replaces grains with dark, hard fungal structures.
It reduces grain yield and quality.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Millet Stem Borers**
Use resistant varieties like SOSAT-C88. Apply insecticides such as cypermethrin. Remove and burn affected plants.

- **Grasshoppers**
Use neem-based biopesticides. Apply insecticides like deltamethrin in severe cases.

- **Weevils (Stored Grains)**
Store grains in hermetic bags or airtight silos. Fumigate storage units with phosphine.

### 2. Diseases
- **Blast Disease**
Use fungicides like mancozeb or carbendazim. Rotate crops to reduce fungal buildup.

- **Downy Mildew**
Treat seeds with fungicides before planting. Remove infected plants immediately.

- **Ergot Disease**
Use clean seeds. Apply fungicides during flowering.

## Fertilizers Required
- Apply NPK (15:15:15) fertilizer at planting.
- Top-dress with urea (46% nitrogen) 4-6 weeks after planting.
- Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or farmyard manure, to improve soil fertility.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- Weed the field regularly during the first 4-5 weeks to reduce competition for nutrients.
- Monitor for signs of pest or disease infestation, and apply necessary controls.
- Ensure adequate soil moisture, particularly during flowering and grain formation stages.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest when the grains are hard and the stalks turn yellow, usually 3-4 months after planting.
- Use a sickle or knife to cut millet heads.
- Dry the harvested heads under the sun to reduce moisture content before threshing.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- Dry millet grains to 12-14% moisture content before storage.
- Store in clean, dry, and pest-free containers or hermetic bags.
- Fumigate storage facilities to prevent pest infestations.
