# Rice
Rice (Oryza sativa or Oryza glaberrima) is one of the world’s most important cereal crops and a staple food in Nigeria. Native to Asia (Oryza sativa) and Africa (Oryza glaberrima), rice has become a key part of Nigerian diets and agriculture. With over 8 million metric tons consumed annually, rice is cultivated extensively across the country, making Nigeria a leading producer in Africa.

## Seed Types
In Nigeria, rice is cultivated using the following seed types:

- **Local Varieties:** Oryza glaberrima, which is hardy and resistant to pests but lower-yielding.
- **Improved Varieties:** Varieties like FARO 44 (SIPI), FARO 52 (WITA 4), and FARO 57, developed for higher yields, pest resistance, and tolerance to flooding and drought.

## Market Demand
Rice has an ever-growing market in Nigeria due to its role as a staple food. Local demand exceeds production, resulting in imports to fill the gap. The Nigerian government’s push for self-sufficiency has created opportunities for local production, with increasing demand from:

- Household consumption.
- Food processing industries (e.g., rice flour).
- Export markets for parboiled and milled rice.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When:** Plant rice during the wet season (April to June) or the dry season using irrigation (October to December).
- **Where:** Rice grows best in lowland areas, swamps, or upland fields with adequate water supply. Major growing areas include Kebbi, Ebonyi, Niger, and Ekiti states.
- **How:** Prepare the field through plowing and harrowing. Sow seeds either by direct seeding or transplanting seedlings into flooded fields. Maintain a spacing of 20-25 cm between rows for optimal growth.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Rice Stem Borers:**
Stem borers are larvae of moths that bore into the rice stem, feeding on the internal tissues.
It can cause "deadheart" (young shoots drying up) and "whiteheads" (panicles that do not produce grains). It can lead to reduced yield and poor plant growth.

- **African Rice Gall Midge:**
This pest causes swelling or "galls" on the rice plant’s stems, reducing the plant’s ability to produce grains.
It leads to stunted plant growth. It can also cause significant yield losses, especially in lowland and swampy areas.

- **Rice Weevils (Stored Grains):**
Rice weevils are small beetles that infest grains during storage. They lay eggs inside the grains, and the larvae feed on the kernel. It can lead to reduced grain weight and quality. It can also lead to increased spoilage and economic losses.

### 2. Diseases
- **Rice Blast:**
It is caused by the fungus *Magnaporthe oryzae*, rice blast affects all parts of the plant, including leaves, stems, and panicles.
The symptoms include: 
- Lesions on leaves that start as small, grayish spots and expand to larger, spindle-shaped spots with dark edges.
- Weakened stems that break easily.

- **Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB):**
This is a bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae*. Common in warm, humid environments. 
Symptoms are: 
- Yellowing and wilting of leaves starting from the tip.
- Leaves eventually dry out and die.

- **Sheath Rot:**
This is a fungal disease caused by Sarocladium oryzae, affecting the sheath and panicle.
Symptoms are:
- Dark brown or reddish lesions on the sheath.
- Rotting of the panicle, leading to incomplete grain filling.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases

### 1. Pests
- **Rice Stem Borers:** Use resistant varieties, apply neem-based biopesticides, and practice early planting. Apply insecticides like chlorpyrifos for severe infestations.
- **African Rice Gall Midge:** Use resistant varieties and ensure timely planting. Avoid planting near infested fields.
- **Rice Weevils:** Dry grains thoroughly before storage and use hermetic bags or fumigants like phosphine to control infestations.

### 2. Diseases
- **Rice Blast:** Plant resistant varieties, reduce nitrogen fertilizer application, and apply fungicides like tricyclazole.
- **Bacterial Leaf Blight:** Avoid overwatering, plant resistant varieties, and use copper-based bactericides.
- **Sheath Rot:** Ensure proper water management and use fungicides such as carbendazim or mancozeb.

## Fertilizers Required
- Apply NPK (20:10:10 or 15:15:15) at planting.
- Supplement with urea (46% nitrogen) during the tillering stage.
- Organic fertilizers, such as compost or farmyard manure, can improve soil fertility and structure.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- Weed regularly, especially within the first 4-6 weeks after planting.
- Manage water levels to keep fields flooded during the vegetative phase and drain slightly before harvest.
- Monitor for pests and diseases through regular scouting and take immediate action when issues arise.
- Apply fertilizers at critical stages such as tillering and panicle initiation for better yield.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest rice when about 80% of the grains in a panicle have turned golden. This typically occurs 30-40 days after flowering.
- Use a sickle or combine harvester for cutting rice plants.
- Thresh the grains to separate them from the stalks, then dry them to a moisture content of 12-14% before storage.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- Dry rice thoroughly to prevent fungal growth and insect infestations.
- Store in clean, dry, and pest-free environments using hermetic bags or silos.
- Use pesticides or fumigants like phosphine tablets in cases of pest infestation.
- Regularly inspect storage facilities for signs of spoilage or infestation.
