# Maize

Maize, also known as corn, is a cereal crop that originated in Central America but has become a staple food in many parts of the world, including Nigeria. It was introduced to West Africa in the 16th century and has since become one of Nigeria's most important crops due to its adaptability to diverse climatic conditions and its versatility in local diets and industries.


## Seed Types

In Nigeria, maize is cultivated using the following seed types:

- **Local Varieties:** Typically drought-tolerant but with lower yields.
- **Hybrid Varieties:** Improved seeds like SAMMAZ 52, 53, and 54 developed by research institutes such as IITA, which offer higher yields, resistance to pests, and shorter growing periods.
- **Genetically Modified (GM) Varieties:** These are less common but are engineered to resist pests and tolerate drought.

## Market Demand

Maize is in high demand in Nigeria for:

- Human consumption (pap, tuwo, roasted corn, and cornmeal).
- Animal feed production (poultry and livestock industries).
- Industrial use (starch, ethanol, and corn oil).
The demand for maize continues to grow due to population increase and its industrial applications.

## When/Where/How To Plant
- **When:** Maize is planted during the rainy season, with optimal planting periods between March and July depending on the region. Early planting ensures better yields.
- **Where:** Maize grows best in regions with well-drained sandy-loam soil and temperatures of 20–30°C. Key growing areas include Kaduna, Kano, Oyo, and Plateau states.
- **How:** Prepare the soil through plowing and harrowing. Plant seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm, spaced 25-30 cm apart, and maintain row spacing of 75-90 cm for mechanization.

## Target Pests And Diseases
### 1. Pests

- **Stem Borers:**
These are larvae of moths that burrow into maize stems and feed on the plant's internal tissues. They weaken the plant structure, reduce water and nutrient flow, and lead to poor grain development or plant death.

- **Armyworms:**
These caterpillars, especially the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), feed on maize leaves, stems, and cobs. They cause significant leaf damage, reducing photosynthesis and overall yield.

- **Maize Weevils:**
These small beetles infest stored maize, laying eggs that hatch into larvae and feed on the grains. They cause grain weight loss, reduce quality, and increase spoilage risks.

### 2. Diseases

- **Maize Streak Virus (MSV):**
This viral disease is transmitted by leafhoppers and is common in West Africa. They cause yellowish streaks on leaves, stunted growth, and poor cob development.

- **Downy Mildew:**
A fungal disease caused by Peronosclerospora spp. that thrives in warm and humid conditions. They cause white or yellow patches on leaves, deformed tassels, and failure to produce viable grains.

- **Leaf Rust:**
This fungal disease, caused by Puccinia sorghi, results in reddish-brown pustules on maize leaves. Premature leaf drying and reduced photosynthesis, leading to lower yields.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests Control
- **Stem Borers:**
Implement crop rotation to disrupt the pest’s lifecycle, and use natural predators such as parasitoid wasps. In cases of severe infestation, apply targeted insecticides like cypermethrin or lambda-cyhalothrin.

- **Armyworms:**
Use pheromone traps to monitor and control population levels, apply biological control agents like *Bacillus thuringiensis*, and use insecticides like emamectin benzoate when necessary. Regular field inspection and early intervention are crucial.

- **Maize Weevils:**
Properly dry maize before storage to prevent weevil development. Use hermetic storage bags or silos, and apply fumigants like phosphine tablets to eliminate weevils in stored grain.

### 2. Diseases Control
- **Maize Streak Virus:**
Plant resistant maize varieties, apply insecticides to control leafhopper vectors, and practice early planting to minimize exposure during peak vector activity.

- **Downy Mildew:**
Use disease-free seeds, apply appropriate fungicides like metalaxyl, and avoid excessive irrigation. Rotate crops regularly and plant resistant varieties where available.

- **Leaf Rust:**
Ensure proper spacing to improve air circulation, apply fungicides such as propiconazole or mancozeb, and remove infected leaves to prevent disease spread. Cultivate rust-resistant varieties to minimize outbreaks.

## Fertilizers Required
- Apply nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea or NPK (15:15:15) shortly after planting.
- A second application of fertilizer is recommended during the tasseling stage to promote grain formation.
- Organic manure like poultry droppings can also be used to enrich the soil.

## Things to do during Growth Phase
- Weed the farm regularly, especially during the first six weeks after planting.
- Ensure proper irrigation during dry spells.
- Conduct routine monitoring to identify early signs of pest infestation or nutrient deficiencies.
- Apply fertilizer as recommended to boost plant growth.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest maize when the husks turn brown and the kernels are firm and shiny.
- For dry maize, allow the cobs to dry on the stalk before harvesting to reduce post-harvest losses.
- Use manual or mechanical methods to remove cobs from the stalks.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- Dry the maize thoroughly (to a moisture content of 12-14%) to prevent fungal growth or aflatoxin contamination.
- Store in jute bags or silos with proper aeration in a cool, dry environment.
- Use pesticides like phosphine tablets to control storage pests.
- Periodically check storage facilities for signs of infestation or spoilage.
