# Sorghum
Sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor*) is a staple crop in Nigeria, originating from Africa. It is the fifth most important cereal globally and a key source of food, fodder, and industrial raw materials. Known for its drought resistance, sorghum thrives in Nigeria’s northern regions, including Kano, Katsina, and Borno, where rainfall is limited. 

Sorghum is a staple crop in Nigeria, originating from Africa. It is the fifth most important cereal globally and a key source of food, fodder, and industrial raw materials. Known for its drought resistance, sorghum thrives in Nigeria’s northern regions, including Kano, Katsina, and Borno, where rainfall is limited.

## Seed Types
- **Local Varieties:** Traditional varieties like Kaura and Farafara are popular but lower-yielding.
- **Improved Varieties:** SAMSORG series (e.g., SAMSORG 17 and SAMSORG 45), developed by research institutes, are higher-yielding, drought-tolerant, and disease-resistant.

## Market Demand
Sorghum is in high demand for:
- **Food:** Traditional dishes like tuwo, pap, and kunu.
- **Industry:** Used in brewing beer, producing syrups, and as animal feed.
- **Export:** Sorghum from Nigeria is sought after in international markets due to its quality.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When:** Plant during the rainy season, typically from May to July.
- **Where:** Sorghum grows best in semi-arid regions with loamy or sandy soils. Major producing states include Kaduna, Bauchi, and Niger.
- **How:** Prepare the land by plowing and harrowing. Sow seeds at a depth of 2-5 cm with spacing of 75 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Stem Borers**
It consists of larvae of moths that bore into sorghum stems, disrupting water and nutrient flow.
It causes stunted growth and “deadheart” (plant death).

- **Shoot Fly**
Adult flies lay eggs on young sorghum plants, and larvae feed on the central shoot.
It damages the central shoot, leading to reduced yields.

- **Sorghum Midge**
This is a tiny insect that lays eggs in sorghum flowers, and larvae feed on developing grains.
It leads to empty grains and yield loss.

### 2. Diseases
- **Anthracnose**
This is caused by the fungus *Colletotrichum sublineola*, it affects leaves, stems, and panicles.
The symptoms are red or purple lesions on leaves and panicles.

- **Sooty Stripe**
This is a fungal disease that creates long, dark streaks on leaves.
The symptoms are premature leaf death and reduced photosynthesis.

- **Grain Mold**
This is caused by multiple fungi, it affects grains during wet weather at harvest time.
The symptoms are discolored and shriveled grains.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Stem Borers:** Use resistant varieties like SAMSORG 45. Remove affected plants. Apply insecticides like chlorpyrifos or cypermethrin.

- **Shoot Fly:** Practice early planting to avoid peak infestation periods. Use soil-applied insecticides such as carbofuran.

- **Sorghum Midge:** Use resistant varieties. Spray insecticides like lambda-cyhalothrin during flowering.

### 2. Diseases
- **Anthracnose:** Plant resistant varieties like SAMSORG 17. Apply fungicides like mancozeb or propiconazole.

- **Sooty Stripe:** Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plant debris.

- **Grain Mold:** Harvest at the right time. Dry grains quickly and store in moisture-free conditions.

## Fertilizers Required
- Use NPK (15:15:15) at planting for balanced nutrition.
- Apply urea (46% nitrogen) during the tillering phase.
- Organic fertilizers like compost improve soil fertility.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- Weed regularly, especially within the first 4-6 weeks.
- Monitor for pests and diseases, and take immediate action when necessary.
- Ensure adequate soil moisture, particularly during flowering and grain-filling stages.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest when grains are hard and dry, usually 4-6 months after planting.
- Use a sickle or mechanical harvester to cut stalks.
- Dry grains to 12-14% moisture content before threshing and storage.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- Store sorghum grains in clean, dry, and pest-free containers.
- Use hermetic bags or silos to prevent pest infestations.
- Fumigate stored grains with phosphine tablets to control weevils.
