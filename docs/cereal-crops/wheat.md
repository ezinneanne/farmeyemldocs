# Wheat
Wheat (Triticum spp.) is a globally significant cereal crop, primarily used for bread, pasta, and other baked goods. In Nigeria, wheat is cultivated in cooler regions, particularly in the northern states such as Borno, Yobe, and Kano. It thrives during the dry season under irrigation and is becoming increasingly important due to the growing demand for flour-based products.

## Seed Types
- Local Varieties: These are traditional but generally low-yielding.
- Improved Varieties: Examples include Norman Borlaug and Seri M82, developed for resistance to diseases and pests, as well as better yields.

## Market Demand
Wheat has a strong market demand in Nigeria for:

- **Flour Milling:** Used for bread, pasta, and noodles.
- **Animal Feed:** By-products like bran are used in feed.
- **Industrial Uses:** Wheat is also used in the production of starch and alcohol.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When:** Plant wheat during the dry season (October to December) to take advantage of irrigation.
- **Where:** Grows best in the semi-arid northern regions of Nigeria with well-drained, loamy soils and a pH of 6.0â€“7.5.
- **How:** Prepare the land by plowing, leveling, and creating ridges or beds. Sow seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm, with spacing of 20 cm between rows.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Aphids**
These are small, sap-sucking insects that feed on wheat leaves and stems.It reduces plant vigor and can transmit viral diseases.

- **Wheat Stem Borers**
Larvae of moths bore into stems, disrupting nutrient flow. It causes stunted growth and weakens plants, leading to lodging.

- **Grain Weevils (Stored Wheat)**
Beetles that infest stored wheat grains, laying eggs inside kernels. Reduces grain quality and weight.

### 2. Diseases
- **Leaf Rust**
This is caused by the fungus *Puccinia triticina*. It forms orange-red pustules on leaves and reduces photosynthesis, causing lower yields.

- **Powdery Mildew**
This is a fungal disease that causes white, powdery patches on leaves.
It weakens plants and reduces yields.

- **Fusarium Head Blight**
This is a fungal disease that affects wheat heads, leading to shriveled grains, reducing yield and grain quality.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Aphids:** Apply insecticides like imidacloprid. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs. Use neem-based biopesticides for eco-friendly control.

- **Wheat Stem Borers:** Use resistant varieties like Norman Borlaug. Apply insecticides like chlorpyrifos during early growth stages.

- **Grain Weevils (Stored Wheat):** Store wheat in hermetic bags or silos. Fumigate storage facilities with phosphine gas.

### 2. Diseases
- **Leaf Rust:** Plant resistant varieties like Seri M82. Apply fungicides like propiconazole or tebuconazole.

- **Powdery Mildew:** Rotate crops to break the disease cycle. Apply fungicides like sulfur or potassium bicarbonate.

- **Fusarium Head Blight:** Use clean, disease-free seeds. Apply fungicides at flowering, such as carbendazim.

## Fertilizers Required
- Apply NPK (15:15:15) fertilizer at planting.
- Top-dress with urea (46% nitrogen) during tillering and booting stages.
- Add organic manure or compost to improve soil fertility and water retention.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- Weed regularly, particularly in the first 4-6 weeks.
- Monitor for pests and diseases, and apply control measures promptly.
- Ensure adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages like booting and grain-filling.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest when wheat grains are fully mature and hard, typically 4-5 months after planting.
- Use a sickle or combine harvester to cut the wheat heads.
- Dry grains to 12-14% moisture content before threshing and storage.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- Store wheat grains in clean, dry, and pest-free containers.
- Use hermetic storage bags or silos to prevent pest infestation.
- Fumigate storage units with phosphine to protect against grain weevils and other pests.
