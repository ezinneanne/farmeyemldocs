# Bambara Nut
Bambara nut (*Vigna subterranea*), also known as the "poor man’s nut," is a legume indigenous to Africa. It is a resilient crop that thrives in semi-arid regions, contributing significantly to food security. In Nigeria, Bambara nut is valued for its high protein content, ability to grow in marginal soils, and tolerance to drought. It is often used in porridge, snacks, and flour production.

## Seed Types
- **Local Varieties:**
Domestically cultivated varieties with varying colors such as cream, brown, red, and black.
Common in traditional farming systems.

- **Improved Varieties:**
High-yielding and disease-resistant varieties developed by agricultural research institutes in Nigeria.

## Market Demand
- **Food Consumption:** Used in traditional Nigerian dishes, snacks, and porridge.
- **Nutritional Value:** Rich in protein, carbohydrates, and essential amino acids, making it a staple for rural communities.
- **Industrial Use:** Used for making flour and as a substitute for soybean in animal feed.
- **Export:** Increasing interest in export markets for its nutritional and drought-resistant qualities.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When to Plant:**
Best planted early in the rainy season (May to June) to ensure optimal growth.

- **Where to Plant:**
Thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with a pH of 5.0–6.5.
Grows well in regions like the North Central and parts of the South West, including states like Niger, Kaduna, and Oyo.

- **How to Plant:**
Prepare the land by plowing and harrowing to achieve fine tilth.
Plant seeds at a depth of 5-6 cm, spaced 20-25 cm apart within rows and 50-60 cm between rows.
Use untreated seeds or seeds treated with Rhizobium inoculants to improve nitrogen fixation.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests:
- **Aphids:**
Suck sap from plants, causing stunted growth and reduced yields.

- **Pod Borers:**
Larvae that attack pods and seeds, reducing seed quality.

- **Termites:**
Feed on pods and roots, causing significant losses during growth and storage.

- **Weevils:**
Damage stored seeds by boring holes, making them unsuitable for consumption or planting.

### 2. Diseases:
- **Leaf Spot (Cercospora spp.):**
Causes brown spots on leaves, leading to defoliation.

- **Fusarium Wilt:**
A soil-borne fungal disease that causes wilting and yellowing of plants.

- **Powdery Mildew:**
White powdery growth on leaves, reducing photosynthesis and vigor.

- **Root Rot:**
Caused by fungal pathogens, leading to decayed roots and poor plant anchorage.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests:
- **Aphids:**
Use insecticides like neem-based sprays or dimethoate.
Introduce natural predators such as ladybugs.

- **Pod Borers:**
Apply biological control agents such as Bacillus thuringiensis.
Spray insecticides like lambda-cyhalothrin at the pod development stage.

- **Termites:**
Treat the soil with chlorpyrifos before planting.
Remove crop residues to prevent termite infestations.

- **Weevils:**
Store seeds in airtight containers and fumigate with phosphine.

### 2. Diseases:
- **Leaf Spot:**
Spray fungicides like mancozeb or chlorothalonil.
Rotate crops to reduce disease incidence.

- **Fusarium Wilt:**
Use resistant varieties and improve soil drainage.
Apply soil amendments like compost to suppress fungal activity.

- **Powdery Mildew:**
Apply sulfur-based fungicides or neem oil sprays.
Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing.

- **Root Rot:**
Avoid waterlogged soils and improve drainage.
Treat seeds with fungicides before planting.

## Fertilizers Required
- **Organic Manure:** Apply compost or farmyard manure at planting to enhance soil fertility.
- **Phosphorus Fertilizer:** Apply Single Super Phosphate (SSP) to promote root and pod development.
- **Nitrogen Fertilizer:** Bambara nuts fix nitrogen, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. However, inoculating seeds with Rhizobium can enhance nitrogen fixation.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- **Weed Control:** Weed manually or use pre-emergent herbicides during the early stages of growth.
- **Irrigation:** Provide supplementary water if rainfall is insufficient, especially during flowering and pod development.
- **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Inspect fields regularly and apply treatments as needed.
- **Thinning:** Remove weak seedlings to maintain proper spacing and ensure robust plant development.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest 90–120 days after planting when the leaves turn yellow and pods mature.
- Uproot the plants carefully using hoes or by hand to avoid pod damage.
- Dry harvested plants in the sun for 2-3 days before removing the pods.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- **Drying:** Ensure pods are thoroughly dried to a moisture content of 8–10%.
- **Shelling:** Shell pods gently to prevent seed damage.
- **Storage:** Store seeds in airtight containers or jute bags in a cool, dry place to prevent weevil infestations.
- **Fumigation:** Use fumigants like phosphine to control storage pests.
- **Inspection:** Regularly check stored seeds for moisture and pest activity.
