# Cowpea
Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), commonly known as beans in Nigeria, is one of the most important leguminous crops in the country. Native to Africa, it is widely grown in Nigeria, particularly in the northern regions, due to its ability to thrive in semi-arid conditions. Cowpea is a key source of protein and a staple food ingredient in popular dishes such as moi-moi, akara, and beans porridge.

## Seed Types
- **Local Varieties:** Adapted to specific regions but often lower in yield. Examples include Dan Ila and Kanannado.
- **Improved Varieties:** Developed for higher yields and pest resistance, such as SAMPEA-11, IT97K-499-35, and IT98K-205-8.
- **Dual-Purpose Varieties:** Suitable for grain and fodder, providing benefits for both human consumption and livestock feeding.

## Market Demand
Cowpea has a strong market demand for:

- **Food Production:** Used in preparing various traditional dishes.
- **Livestock Feed:** The haulms (dried stems and leaves) are a valuable animal feed.
- **Export Market:** Nigeria exports cowpea to neighboring countries and beyond.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When:** Cowpea is planted at the onset of the rainy season, typically between May and July, depending on the region. A second planting is possible during the late season, from September to October, in areas with adequate moisture.
- **Where:** Thrives in sandy-loam soils with good drainage and pH levels of 6.0-7.0. Major producing areas include Kano, Katsina, Borno, and Bauchi states.
- **How:**
- Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing to ensure proper aeration.
- Plant seeds at a depth of 2-4 cm, spacing rows 75 cm apart and plants 20-30 cm apart within rows.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Cowpea Weevils (Callosobruchus maculatus)**
These are small beetles that infest stored cowpea grains. They lay eggs on the grains, and the larvae feed on the seeds from the inside, causing significant damage and loss. Signs of infestation are presence of holes in the grains and powdery residue inside storage containers. It causes loss of seed weight and quality.

- **Aphids**
These are small, soft-bodied insects that suck sap from leaves, stems, and pods. They are often found in clusters on the underside of leaves or along stems. Signs of infestation are sticky, shiny residue,(honeydew) on leaves, and presence of ants attracted to the honeydew. It leads to yellowing, curling of leaves and stunted plant growth.

- **Pod Borers**
These are caterpillars of moths that feed on flowers and developing pods, leading to reduced seed production.
Signs of Infestation are holes in pods and presence of caterpillars inside the pods. It leads to poor pod formation and direct damage to seeds within the pods.

- **Thrips**
These are tiny, slender insects that attack the flowers of cowpea, feeding on their tissues. Signs of Infestation are
deformed or discolored flowers, and silvery streaks on leaves and flowers.
It causes poor flower development.

### 2. Diseases
- **Bacterial Blight**
This is a bacterial infection that affects cowpea leaves, stems, and pods. It is spread through infected seeds, soil, or water. Symptoms are presence of leaf spots that coalese to form blighted areas, and oozing from lesions in humid conditions. It causes yellowing, wilting of leaves and black or brown water-soaked lesions on leaves and pods.

- **Fusarium Wilt**
This is a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum. It infects the roots, restricting water and nutrient uptake. Symptoms are discolored vascular tissue when stems are cut open, and stunted growth. The effects are wilting of plants, even in moist soil, yellowing of leaves and eventual death of the plant.

- **Cowpea Mosaic Virus (CPMV)**
This is a viral disease spread primarily by aphids. It causes characteristic mosaic patterns on the leaves. Symptoms include mosaic or mottled appearance on leaves, and distorted leaves. The effects are stunted plant growth, reduced pood and seed production.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Cowpea Weevils:** Store grains in hermetic bags or airtight containers. Treat storage units with diatomaceous earth or fumigants like phosphine.

- **Aphids:** Use neem oil or insecticidal soap sprays. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs.

- **Pod Borers:** Apply insecticides such as cypermethrin during flowering and pod formation. Rotate crops to break the pest lifecycle.

- **Thrips:** Plant resistant varieties like SAMPEA-11. Use insecticides like lambda-cyhalothrin.

### Diseases
- **Bacterial Blight:** Use disease-free seeds. Apply copper-based fungicides.

- **Fusarium Wilt:** Rotate crops with non-legumes. Use fungicide-treated seeds.

- **Cowpea Mosaic Virus(CPMV):** Plant resistant varieties like IT98K-205-8. Control aphids, the primary vector, using insecticides.

## Fertilizers Required
- Apply a basal fertilizer like NPK (15:15:15) at planting, at 50-60 kg/ha.
- Cowpea fixes nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for additional nitrogen fertilizer.
- Add phosphorus-rich fertilizers like Single Super Phosphate (SSP) for better root development.
- Incorporate farmyard manure or compost to improve soil fertility.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- Weed regularly within the first 4-6 weeks to reduce competition.
- Provide adequate irrigation during dry spells, especially during flowering and pod formation.
- Monitor fields for signs of pest and disease infestations, and apply control measures as needed.
- Stake plants in areas with heavy winds to prevent lodging.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest cowpea pods when they are dry and have turned yellow-brown, about 75-90 days after planting.
- Use a sickle or knife to cut pods without damaging the plants.
- Dry the pods under the sun to reduce moisture content before threshing.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- Ensure grains are thoroughly dried to 12-14% moisture content before storage.
- Store in hermetic bags or airtight containers to prevent pest infestations.
- Fumigate storage units with phosphine gas to eliminate residual pests.
- Avoid mixing freshly harvested grains with old stock to prevent contamination.
