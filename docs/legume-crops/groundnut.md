# Groundnut
Groundnut (*Arachis hypogaea*), also known as peanut, is a leguminous crop native to South America but widely cultivated in Nigeria. Introduced to West Africa during the Portuguese exploration era, groundnuts have become a staple in Nigeria, particularly in the northern regions. Known for their high protein and oil content, groundnuts are essential for food, oil production, and export.

## Seed Types
- **Local Varieties:**
Examples: Samnut 22, 23, and 24 are drought-resistant and suitable for traditional farming systems.

- **Improved Varieties:**
Developed by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and Nigerian institutes, these include Samnut 25, 26, and 27, known for their high yield, disease resistance, and oil content.

## Market Demand
Groundnuts are in high demand for:

- **Food Production:** Snacks (roasted peanuts, peanut butter), soups, and confectionery.
- **Oil Extraction:** Groundnut oil is widely used for cooking and industrial purposes.
- **Animal Feed:** Groundnut cake (a byproduct) is used in livestock feeds.
- **Export:** Groundnuts are exported to other African countries and Europe.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When to Plant:**
Best planted at the beginning of the rainy season (April to June) in Nigeria. Late planting (August) is also possible in some regions.

- **Where to Plant:**
Grows well in well-drained sandy loam soils with a pH of 6.0â€“6.5.
Thrives in the warm, semi-arid regions of Nigeria, such as Kano, Kaduna, Jigawa, and Sokoto states.

- **How to Plant:**
Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing.
Plant seeds at a depth of 5-6 cm, spaced 10-15 cm apart within rows, and 50-60 cm between rows.
Use treated seeds to prevent early pest and disease attacks.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests:
- **Aphids:** Sap-sucking insects that transmit groundnut rosette virus.
- **Termites:** Attack pods and roots, causing yield losses.
- **Groundnut Leaf Miner:** Larvae feed on leaves, reducing photosynthesis.
- **Thrips:** Cause leaf curling and stunted growth.
- **Weevils:** Damage stored groundnut seeds.

### Diseases:
- **Groundnut Rosette Virus:** Causes stunted growth, yellowing, and mosaic patterns on leaves.
- **Leaf Spot (Early and Late):** Fungal disease causing brown spots on leaves.
- **Aspergillus Flavus:** Causes aflatoxin contamination in stored groundnuts.
- **Cercospora Leaf Spot:** Leads to defoliation and reduced yield.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests:
- **Aphids:**
- Use resistant varieties like Samnut 24.
- Spray insecticides such as dimethoate when necessary.
- Practice crop rotation.

- **Termites:**
- Apply insecticides like chlorpyrifos during planting.
- Remove crop residues to reduce termite habitats.

- **Groundnut Leaf Miner:**
- Use biological control agents like parasitic wasps.
- Spray neem-based pesticides.

- **Thrips:**
- Apply insecticides like lambda-cyhalothrin.
- Avoid planting near heavily infested fields.

- **Weevils:**
Store groundnuts in airtight containers and fumigate with phosphine.

### 2. Diseases:
- **Groundnut Rosette Virus:**
- Plant resistant varieties such as Samnut 26.
- Control aphid vectors.

- **Leaf Spot:**
- Spray fungicides like mancozeb or carbendazim.
- Practice good field hygiene.

- **Aspergillus Flavus:**
- Harvest at the right time to avoid aflatoxin contamination.
- Dry seeds thoroughly before storage.

## Fertilizers Required
- **Phosphorus Fertilizer:** Apply Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at planting to boost root development.
- **Potassium Fertilizer:** Use potassium chloride if the soil is deficient.
- **Organic Manure:** Apply compost or well-rotted manure before planting to improve soil fertility.
- **Inoculants:** Treat seeds with Rhizobium inoculants to enhance nitrogen fixation.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- **Weed Control:** Weed regularly during the first 6 weeks of growth.
- **Irrigation:** Provide additional water if rainfall is insufficient, particularly during flowering and pod formation.
- **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Inspect fields regularly and take timely action to prevent outbreaks.
- **Thinning:** Remove weak plants to ensure proper spacing.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest groundnuts 90-120 days after planting when leaves turn yellow and pods are fully developed.
- Use hoes or manual lifting to uproot plants without damaging pods.
- Allow the plants to dry for 2-3 days before threshing.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- **Drying:** Dry pods in the sun to a moisture content of 8-10%.
- **Shelling:** Shell groundnuts carefully to avoid damage to the seeds.
- **Storage:** Store in clean, dry, and airtight containers to prevent pest and mold infestation.
- **Fumigation:** Use fumigants like phosphine tablets to protect stored groundnuts from weevils and other pests.
- **Periodic Inspection:** Regularly check stored groundnuts for signs of pests or moisture.
