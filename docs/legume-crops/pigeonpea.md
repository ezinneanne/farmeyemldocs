# Pigeon Pea
Pigeonpea (*Cajanus cajan*) is a legume native to India, but it has been cultivated in Africa for centuries. In Nigeria, it's known by various names, including *fiofio* or *mgbụmgbụ* (Igbo), *waken-masar* or *waken-turawa* (Hausa), and *òtílí* (Yoruba). It's primarily grown in the Guinea Savannah zones of the country. Despite its nutritional and economic importance, pigeonpea remains an underutilized crop in Nigeria, with low yields and limited research attention.

## Seed Types
- **Local varieties:** Nigerian farmers predominantly use local varieties, which are adapted to specific agro-ecological zones. These varieties often have diverse characteristics in terms of seed size, color, and growth habit.   

- **Improved varieties:** There is a need for the development and promotion of improved pigeonpea varieties in Nigeria. These varieties should focus on traits like higher yield, disease resistance, and shorter cooking time.

## Market Demand
Pigeonpea is consumed as a pulse in Nigeria, used in soups, stews, and other dishes. It's also a valuable source of protein for livestock feed. However, the demand for pigeonpea in Nigeria is relatively low compared to other legumes like cowpea. This is partly due to its longer cooking time and limited awareness of its nutritional benefits. There is potential to increase market demand through:   

- **Promoting its nutritional value:** Highlighting the protein, fiber, and micronutrient content of pigeonpea.   
- **Developing value-added products:** Creating processed pigeonpea products that are more convenient for consumers.   
- **Improving cooking methods:** Promoting techniques that reduce cooking time, such as soaking or pressure cooking.

## Planting
- **When:** Pigeonpea is typically planted at the beginning of the rainy season (April-June in Southern Nigeria, June-August in Northern Nigeria).
- **Where:** It thrives in well-drained loamy soils with a pH of 5-7. It's commonly intercropped with other crops like yam, millet, sorghum, and cassava.   
- **How:** Seeds are sown directly into the soil at a depth of 2-5 cm. Spacing depends on the variety and cropping system, but a common practice is to plant in rows 60-90 cm apart, with 30-60 cm between plants within rows.

## Target Pests and Diseases:
### 1. Pests
- **Pod borers:** These insects bore into the pods and damage the developing seeds.   
- **Aphids:** These small insects suck sap from the plants, causing stunted growth.   
- **Storage pests:** Weevils can infest stored pigeonpea seeds.

### 2. Diseases
- **Wilt:** A fungal disease that causes plants to wilt and die.
- **Sterility mosaic:** A viral disease that prevents pod formation.   

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
- **Cultural practices:** Crop rotation, intercropping, and timely planting can help reduce pest and disease incidence.
- **Biological control:** Using natural enemies of pests, such as beneficial insects and microorganisms.
- **Chemical control:** Applying appropriate insecticides and fungicides when necessary. However, this should be done judiciously to minimize environmental impact.   
- **Resistant varieties:** Planting pigeonpea varieties that are resistant to specific pests and diseases.   
- **Storage:** Proper drying of seeds before storage and use of airtight containers or storage with inert materials such as ash can prevent storage pests.   

## Fertilizers
Pigeonpea is a legume that can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers. However, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers may be required, especially in soils that are deficient in these nutrients. Soil testing can help determine the appropriate type and amount of fertilizer to apply. Organic fertilizers like compost and manure can also be beneficial.

## Growth Phase Activities:
- **Weed control:** Regular weeding is important, especially during the early growth stages, to reduce competition for nutrients and water.   
- **Earthing up:** This involves mounding soil around the base of the plants to provide support and improve drainage.   
- **Pest and disease monitoring:** Regular scouting for pests and diseases is crucial for timely intervention.

## Harvesting
Pigeonpea is typically harvested when the pods are dry and turn brown. This is usually 3-5 months after planting, depending on the variety and environmental conditions. Harvesting is done manually by picking the pods from the plants.

## Preservation and Storage:
- **Drying:** After harvesting, the pods are dried in the sun to reduce moisture content and prevent spoilage.   
- **Threshing:** The dried pods are threshed to separate the seeds.   
- **Storage:** The seeds should be stored in a cool, dry place in airtight containers or bags. Mixing the dried seeds with ash or other inert materials can help prevent insect infestation during storage.
