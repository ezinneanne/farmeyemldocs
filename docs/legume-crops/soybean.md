# Soybean
Soybean (*Glycine max*) is a leguminous crop native to East Asia, but it has become widely cultivated across Nigeria due to its nutritional and industrial importance. Introduced to Nigeria in the early 20th century, soybean is now a key crop in northern regions like Kaduna, Benue, and Niger states. It is valued for its high protein content and oil production.

## Seed Types
- **Local Varieties:** Traditional varieties like TGx 536-02, commonly grown for their adaptability to Nigerian soils.
- **Improved Varieties:** High-yield, disease-resistant types developed by research institutes, such as TGx 1835-10E and TGx 1448-2E.

## Market Demand
Soybeans are in high demand for:

- **Food Industry:** Used in making soy milk, tofu, soy flour, and cooking oil.
- **Livestock Feed:** Soybean meal is a major component of poultry and livestock feed.
- **Industrial Uses:** Used in the production of biodiesel, adhesives, and lubricants.
- **Export Market:** Soybeans are exported to neighboring countries and beyond.

## When/Where/How to Plant
- **When to Plant:**
Soybeans are best planted at the onset of the rainy season, typically between May and June in Nigeria.

- **Where to Plant:**
- Grows well in well-drained loamy soils with a pH of 6.0â€“7.0.
- Thrives in regions with moderate rainfall, such as Kaduna, Benue, Plateau, and Taraba states.

- **How to Plant:**
- Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing.
- Treat seeds with Rhizobium inoculant to enhance nitrogen fixation.
- Sow seeds at a depth of 2-4 cm, with a spacing of 50 cm between rows and 5-10 cm between plants.

## Target Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Aphids**
These are small sap-sucking insects that feed on soybean leaves and stems.
They transmit viral diseases and reduce plant vigor.

- **Pod Borers**
These are larvae of moths that feed on developing soybean pods.
They can cause significant yield losses by damaging seeds within the pods.

- **Thrips**
Tiny insects that feed on flowers, leaves, and pods.
They distort leaves and flowers, reducing photosynthesis and seed formation.

- **Armyworms**
They are caterpillars that feed voraciously on soybean foliage.
They defoliate plants, impacting growth and yield.

- **Root-Knot Nematodes**
They are microscopic worms that attack soybean roots, forming galls, leading to stunted growth and reducing nitrogen fixation.

### 2. Diseases
- **Soybean Rust**
This is caused by fungus (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi*).
Symptoms: Brown or reddish-brown spots on leaves, leading to premature defoliation.

- **Bacterial Blight**
This is caused by Bacteria (*Pseudomonas syringae*). The symptoms include water-soaked spots on leaves that turn brown with yellow halos.

- **Frogeye Leaf Spot**
This is caused by fungus (*Cercospora sojina*). The symptoms include circular spots with gray centers and dark brown margins on leaves.

- **Root Rot**

This is caused bu fungi like Rhizoctonia solani or Fusarium spp.
The symptoms are rotted roots, yellowing leaves, and stunted plants.

- **Purple Seed Stain**
Cause: Fungus (*Cercospora kikuchii*).
Symptoms: Purple discoloration on seeds, reducing quality and marketability.

## How to Control Pests and Diseases
### 1. Pests
- **Aphids**
Apply insecticides like imidacloprid or neem-based biopesticides.
Introduce natural predators such as ladybugs.
Use reflective mulches to deter aphids.

- **Pod Borers**
Apply insecticides like lambda-cyhalothrin during flowering and pod development.
Use pheromone traps to monitor and reduce moth populations.
Destroy crop residues to eliminate overwintering larvae.

- **Thrips**
Use insecticides like spinosad or neem extracts.
Avoid planting near heavily infested crops.

- **Armyworms**
Spray with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or selective insecticides like chlorantraniliprole.
Practice early planting to escape peak infestations.

- **Root-Knot Nematodes**
Rotate soybeans with non-host crops like maize or millet.
Use nematode-resistant soybean varieties.
Apply organic amendments like neem cake or poultry manure.

### 2. Diseases
- **Soybean Rust**
Plant rust-resistant varieties such as TGx 1835-10E.
Apply fungicides like tebuconazole or azoxystrobin.
Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.

- **Bacterial Blight**
Use certified disease-free seeds.
Rotate crops to break the disease cycle.
Avoid overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness.

- **Frogeye Leaf Spot**
Apply fungicides like thiophanate-methyl or chlorothalonil.
Remove and burn infected plant residues.
Use resistant varieties.

- **Root Rot**
Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
Treat seeds with fungicides before planting.
Avoid continuous planting of soybeans in the same field.

- **Purple Seed Stain**
Use fungicide-treated seeds for planting.
Ensure timely harvesting to reduce seed infections.
Store seeds in a cool, dry place to prevent fungal growth.

## Fertilizers Required
- **Phosphorus Fertilizer:** Apply Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at planting to promote root development.
- **Potassium Fertilizer:** Potassium sulfate may be added in potassium-deficient soils.
- **Nitrogen Fixation:** Soybeans fix nitrogen in the soil, so nitrogen fertilizers are not typically required unless the soil is highly deficient.
- **Organic Manure:** Apply compost or well-rotted farmyard manure before planting to enrich soil fertility.

## Things to Do During Growth Phase
- **Weed Management:** Weed regularly during the first 4-6 weeks to reduce competition.
- **Irrigation:** Ensure consistent moisture, particularly during flowering and pod development stages.
- **Pest and Disease Monitoring:**
Watch for common pests like pod borers and armyworms.
Look out for diseases like rust and bacterial blight, and apply appropriate controls.
- **Staking (if necessary):** In high-rainfall areas, staking can prevent lodging.

## Proper Harvesting Procedures
- Harvest soybeans when the pods turn brown and the leaves start to fall, typically 90-120 days after planting.
- Avoid delays in harvesting to prevent shattering (grain loss).
- Use sickles or small hand tools to cut plants close to the ground.
- Allow the harvested plants to dry in the sun for a few days before threshing.

## Best Practices for Preservation and Storage
- **Drying:** Dry soybean grains to a moisture content of 10-12% to prevent mold and spoilage.
- **Storage:** Store in clean, dry, and pest-free containers like hermetic bags or airtight silos.
- **Pest Control:** Fumigate storage facilities with phosphine to prevent infestations by weevils and other pests.
- **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored soybeans for signs of pests or moisture buildup.
